# Phaser-Platformer
JS platformer game, with local database

Made for a school project with two class mates. 

The game was made with phaser, and for local database we used dexie.js. The code has some documentation and explanations in it, 
but in short, the game uses states to work. Every state is a variable that has the code for said state inside of it. 
That way we can have multiple levels and menu screens etc.
